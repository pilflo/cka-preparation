# Security Contexts

A security context defines privilege and access control settings for a Pod or Container.

## Context definition

A Security Context can be defined either for a Pod or a Container (or both).

Some options however like Capabilities can only be defined at a Container level.

A Security Context defined at the Container level overrides the one defined at Pod level.

```yaml
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000
  containers:
  - name: sec-ctx-demo-2
    image: gcr.io/google-samples/node-hello:1.0
    securityContext:
      runAsUser: 2000
      allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
      capabilities:
        add: ["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_TIME"]
```
