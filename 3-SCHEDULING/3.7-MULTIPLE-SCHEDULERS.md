# Multiple Schedulers

By default kubeadm comes with a default scheduler (called default-scheduler).

The kube scheduler implementation can be customized and multiple schedulers can run at a time.

To pick one scheduler or the other, there is the *schedulerName* property that can be passed to a pod Spec.
