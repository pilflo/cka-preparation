# Network Policies

Network Policies are objects that allow to specify how a pod is allowed to communicate with other pods.

By default all the traffic between all pods is allowed within the cluster.

## Definition

A network policy defines rules of communication between pods.

It is made of 3 sections:
- **podSelector**: defines the pods whose network policy will apply. Those pods become the reference for the concept of *Ingress* and *Egress*.
- **policyTypes**: A list of policy types (Ingress/Egress)
- **ingress**/**egress**: Depending on the policy types declared, a bloc *ingress*/*egress* must define the entities the pod can communicate with.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: test-network-policy
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      role: db
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 172.17.0.0/16
            except:
              - 172.17.1.0/24
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              project: myproject
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              role: frontend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 6379
  egress:
    - to:
        - ipBlock:
            cidr: 10.0.0.0/24
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 5978
```

## Selecting pods

The target pods for the ingress/egress rules can be selected using multiple selectors.

Pods can be selected with 
- *ipBlock*: cluster-external IPs CIDR allowed
- *namespaceSelector*: labels on namespace
- *podSelector*: labels on pods
- *namespaceSelector* and *podSelector*: condition between namespace AND label labels.

```yaml
  ...
  # namespace with labels user:alice AND pods with labels role:client
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          user: alice
      podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: client
  ...
```

```yaml
  ...
  # namespace with labels user:alice OR pods with labels role:client
  ingress:
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          user: alice
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          role: client
  ...
```

## Allow all traffic

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-all-ingress
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  ingress: # These 2 lines
  - {} # make the Allow All
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```

## Deny all traffic

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-all-ingress
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```
