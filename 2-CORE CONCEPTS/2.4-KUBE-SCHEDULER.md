# Kube-Scheduler

## Responsibilities

The sole purpose of the kube-scheduler is to schedule pods on nodes.

It uses multiple criteria such as

- resources requirements and limits
- taints and tolerations
- node selectors/affinity

Depending on those criteria, the kube-scheduler filters the nodes that are eligible for running the pod and attributes a score to the eligible nodes on a scale of 0 to 10.

This ranking function can be customized.

## Installation

- Automatically if the installation is done with kubeadm
- Manually by running the kube-scheduler binary
