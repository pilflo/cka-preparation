# Persistent Volume Claims

PVCs is a way to reclaim storage from a PV based on attributes (access modes, storage class, labels ...)

## Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: task-pv-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 500Mi
```

If the claim request matches an existing Persistent Volume the PVC is bound to the PV and can be mounted to a Pod.

## Reclaim Policy

The *persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy* property of a PV defines the behavior when a bound PVC is deleted.
- *Retain*(default): The PV remains until it is manually deleted. It CAN NOT be reused by another PVC.
- *Delete*: The PV is deleted
- *Recycle*: Data is removed from PV and PV is reusable by another PVC.
