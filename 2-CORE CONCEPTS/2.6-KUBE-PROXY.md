# kube-proxy

## Responsibilities

kube-proxy is a process running on each node in the cluster. Its job is to look for new services and every time a new service is created it adds the appropriate rules on each node to forward the traffic to the pods.

One way it does this is using IpTables rules.

## Installation

- Automatically with kubeadm
- Installing the binary on each node otherwise

/!\ kube-proxy is deployed as a daemonset to ensure that it exists on each node in the cluster.
