# Nodes Maintenance

For some reason (OS Upgrades, security patch) we may want to stop/restart a given node.

## Drain

The **drain** command terminates all the workloads on a node and prevent any scheduling on that node.

```bash
kubectl drain node-01
```

## Cordon/Uncordon

The **Cordon** command prevents any new scheduling to happen on a node. However it DOES NOT terminate the workloads on the node.

```bash
kubectl cordon node-01
```

The **Uncordon** command marks the node as ready to receive workload.

```bash
kubectl uncordon node-01
```

Note: A *drained* node is also cordoned. After the maintenance operation, the node needs to be *uncordoned* to receive new workload.
