# kube-controller-manager

## Responsibilities

The kube-controller-manager is a process that continuously monitors the state of various components within the system and works towards bringing the whole system to the desired functioning state.

## Installation

It is made of multiple controllers (node-controller, service-account-controller, replicaset-controller ...) and forms a single unit called kube-controller-manager.

If installed through kubeadm, it is automatically setup in a kube-system pod called kube-controller-manager.

Like other components, it comes with a lot of options allowing to enable/disable controllers and configure them.

By default all controllers are activated.

## Example

The node-controller is responsible for monitoring the status of the nodes and taking necessary actions to keep the application running.

By default the options are

```sh
--node-monitor-period=5s
--node-monitor-grace-period=40s
--pod-eviction-timeout=5m0s
```

meaning that

- the nodes status are scraped every 5s
- a probe failing for 40sec results in an *Unreachable* status
- a node *Unreachable* for 5m is evicted and all its workload are rescheduled to other nodes
