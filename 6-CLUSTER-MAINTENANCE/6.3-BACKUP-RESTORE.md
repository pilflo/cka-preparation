# Backup and Restore

## ETCD backup

When the etcd systemctl service is executed, an option *--data-dir* is passed. This is where the data is stored.

```sh
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/etcd
...
--data-dir=/var/lib/etcd
```

## ETCD Snapshots

You can also choose to do regular snapshots of ETCD

### Do a snapshot

```bash
# Do a snapshot
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save snapshot.db
ls
# snapshot.db
```

### Check snapshot status

```bash
# Do a snapshot
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot status snapshot.db
# Shows the status of the snapshot.db snapshot file
```

### Restore etcd snapshot

```bash
# Stop the kube-apiserver
service kube-apiserver stop
```

```bash
# Update the service with the backup data dir
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/etcd
...
--data-dir=/var/lib/etcd-from-backup
```

```bash
# Restart daemon 
systemctl daemon-reload
# Restart etcd service
service etcd restart
# Restart kube-apiserver
service kube-apiserver start
```

### Note

The commands above are simplified. For each etcd command we need to provide:

```bash
--endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \ #This is the default as ETCD is running on master node and exposed on localhost 2379.
--cacert=/etc/etcd/ca.crt \ # verify certificates of TLS-enabled secure servers using this CA bundle
--cert=/etc/etcd/etcd-server.crt \ # identify secure client using this TLS certificate file
--key=/etc/etcd/etcd-server.key # identify secure client using this TLS key file
```

All this info can be found in the etcd pod's configuration.
