# Taints and Tolerations

*Taints* are set on Nodes.
*Tolerations* are set on Pods.

When a node has a *Taint*, no pods can be schedule on it unless the pod has the corresponding *Toleration*.

## Taints

To add a Taint to a Node :
```bash
kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:<taint-effect>
# kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule
```

*taint-effect* defines what would happen to the pods that DO NOT tolerate the taint.<br>
It can take one of these 3 values:
- *NoSchedule*: the pod will not be scheduled on the node.
- *PreferNoSchedule*: the system will try to avoid this node.
- *NoExecute*: pod will not be scheduled on the node AND currently running pods will be evicted if they don't have the adequate toleration.

## Tolerations

The tolerations are added to the pod spec. It is made of 4 properties.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  tolerations:
  - key: "app"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "blue"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
```
## Notes

/!\ Taints and Tolerations guarantee that pods without a given toleration CAN NOT run on tainted nodes.<br>
However it DOES NOT guarantee that a pod with a toleration will run on a tainted Node. The pod with toleration can be scheduled anywhere else if the scheduler decides so.

You can notice that the scheduler never schedule pods on the master node. This is because the master node is tainted by default.<br>
This behavior can be changed afterwards, however, this is a terrible practice. No applicative workload should run on the master node.
```bash
> kubectl describe node control-plane | grep Taints
Taints: node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule
```
