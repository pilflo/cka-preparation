# DNS

## CoreDNS

From Kubernetes 1.12, **CoreDNS** is the recommended solution for managing DNS in a Kubernetes Cluster.

**CoreDNS** is a deployment with 2 replicas on the *kube-system* namspace.

The **CoreDNS** is reachable through a service named *kube-dns* which has a fixed IP address : **10.96.0.10**

In each pod, the following file is mounted at /etc/resolv.conf so the nameserver is resolved through **CoreDNS**:
```bash
# /etc/resolv.conf
nameserver    10.96.0.10
search   default.svc.cluster.local  svc.cluster.local   cluster.local
```

CoreDNS is configurable using the configmap created in the kube-system namespace.


## Fully Qualified Names


CoreDNS allow us to resolve any Pod or Service withing the cluster.

For services:
- http://*my-service* if we are in the same namespace.
- http://*my-service.namespace*
- http://*my-service.namespace.svc*
- http://*my-service.namespace.svc.cluster.local*


For Pods:
- http://*10-244-2-5.namespace.pod.cluster.local*

Dots are replaced with dashes.<br>
Pods are only reachable with their FQN.
