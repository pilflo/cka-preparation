# Daemon Sets

A Daemon Set deploys exactly 1 pod on each node of the cluster.

When a Node is provisionned, the daemonset created automatically a pod on it.
When a Node is killed, so does the pod.

A Node monitoring, Log collector or Networking solutions are suitable usecases for DaemonSets.

Kube-proxy component is deployed as a DaemonSet.

Tip: There is no *kubectl create daemonset* command available but we can reuse *kubectl get deployment* command and change the Kind and remove replicas field.

## Example

DaemonSets have the same structure as ReplicaSets.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: logs
  labels:
    app: logs
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: logs
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: logs
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: logger
        image: gcr.io/google_samples/logs:v3
```
