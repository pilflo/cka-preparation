# RBAC

The RBAC authorization works by creating Roles (set of scoped permissions) and binding them to Users.

## Role

A role is a set of rules.

Each rule defines:
- **apiGroups**: (can be left blank for *Core* API).
- **resources**: set of object defined in the group.
- **verbs**: actions that a user can perform on *resources*.

Optionally a resourceNames field can filter resources with more precision.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
    name: developer
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] 
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["list“, "get", “create“, “update“, “delete"]
- apiGroups: [""] 
  resources: [“ConfigMap"]
  verbs: [“create“]
```

## RoleBinding

The RoleBinding links the Role to Users.

It has 2 sections:
- **subjects** is where we provide user details.
- **roleRef** is a reference to the bound role.

## Check access

You can check your authorization with the command:
```bash
kubectl auth can-i create deployments
# yes
# Can check another user
kubectl auth can-i create deployments --as readonly-user
# no
```

## ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBindings

ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding have a similar behavior to Role and RoleBindings.

ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBindings serve 2 usecases:

- You want to authorize a user on cluster-wide scoped resources (like PV,Nodes,Namespaces...).
- You want to authorize a user on namespaced resources on ANY namespace.
