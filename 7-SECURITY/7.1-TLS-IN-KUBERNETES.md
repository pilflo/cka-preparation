# TLS in Kubernetes

## Servers Components

In a Kubernetes cluster, 3 components expose an API and act as a *Server*
- The **apiServer**
- The **ETCD** server
- The **kubelet** server

## Client Components

The following components act as clients:

- The **admin/devs** users need to access the *apiServer*
- The **kubeScheduler** needs to access the *apiServer*
- The **controllerManager** needs to access the *apiServer*
- The **kubeProxy** needs to access the *apiServer*
- The **kubelet** needs to access the *apiServer*

Also some servers component act as clients to other server components:
- The **apiServer** needs to access the *ETCD* server
- The **apiServer** needs to access the *kubelet* server
- The **kubelet** needs to access the *apiServer* server

For each communication a TLS-based authentication needs to be performed.

## Certificate Authority

Kubernetes requires at least one certificate authority for the cluster.<br>
A second CA can optionally be used for the ETCD Cluster.

## Certificates API

The kubeadm tool creates the CA server in the master node (and the associated ca.crt and ca.key).<br>

A request object *CertificateSigningRequest* (CSR) can be sent to the API to create a CA-signed certificate for an end-user/3rd party.

The component responsible for managing the CSR request is the *Controller-Manager*. It comes with controllers like CSR-Approving or CSR-Signing that carries the certificates process.

That is why the controller-manager is started with the path to the root ca files.
```
--cluster-signing-cert-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt
--cluster-signing-key-file=/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.key
```
