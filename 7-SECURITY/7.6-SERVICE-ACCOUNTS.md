# Service Accounts

Service Accounts are a way to authorize applications, processes, machines to perform action on the K8S API.

## Default Service Account

By default every namespace comes with a default service account. It has very restricted permissions.

## Service Account Token

When a service account is created, an associated *token* is created as a Kubernetes Secret.

This token can be used as a Bearer token to authorize associated permissions in the cluster.

By specifying a *serviceAccountName* in the pod specification, you automatically provide the associated token to every request the pod will make to the Kubernetes API.

## RBAC

A Service Account can benefit from RBAC.

It can be associated to a Role or ClusterRole by providing the service account name to a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding.

```yaml
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: my-sa
    namespace: prod
```
