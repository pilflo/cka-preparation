# Resource Requests and Limits

## Resource Requests

You can request resources for individual pods.
It can be **CPU, Memory or Disk Space**.

If one of the requests can't be met on the node, the pod can't be scheduled on this node.

If no nodes can satisfy a condition, the pods remains *Pending*.

### CPU

- The CPU is expressed as fraction of a CPU or as millicore (m).
- 0.4 and 400m are equivalent notations.
- The minimum CPU value is 1m.

### Memory

- The memory can be expressed as *byte* or *bibyte* notation.
- 1K = 1,000 bytes - 1M=1,000,000 bytes - 1G=1,000,000,000 bytes.
- 1Ki = 1,024 bytes - 1M=1,048,576 bytes - 1G=1,073,741,824 bytes.

## Resource Limits

### Exceeding Limits

If a pod exceeds the limits:
- If it goes beyond the **CPU limits**, CPU throttling occurs. Performance are likely to be affected but the pod still runs.
- If it goes beyond the **Memory limits**, the pod is *Terminated*

## Defaults

You can set defaults values for a given namespace by creating a LimitRange object.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: cpu-limit-range
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      cpu: 1
    defaultRequest:
      cpu: 0.5
    type: Container
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange
metadata:
  name: mem-limit-range
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      memory: 512Mi
    defaultRequest:
      memory: 256Mi
    type: Container
```
