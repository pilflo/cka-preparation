# Cluster Upgrade

The overall version of a Kubernetes cluster is the one of the **apiServer**.

The node versions are the version of their respective *kubelet*.

Kubernetes ensure the support of *N-2* versions, *N* being the latest release.

## Components Versions

The authorized versions of the different component in a cluster are relative to the version of the **apiServer**.

If *X* is the version of the apiServer,

- The **controller-manager** and the **kube-scheduler** must be at least at version *X-1*

- The **kubelet** and the **kube-proxy** must be at least at version *X-2*

- The **kubectl** tool must be between X-1 and X+1

## *kubeadm* Upgrade Process

- A cluster upgrade must be done 1 version at a time.

- The *master* nodes must be upgraded before the *worker* nodes.

- When the *master* is down, the current workload is still running but not administration or self-healing can happen.

## Master nodes

### Upgrade plan

An overview of the recommended upgrade with all information is available with the command:

```bash
kubeadm upgrade plan
```

### *kubeadm* upgrade

The first step is to upgrade kubeadm

```bash
apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.24.0-00
```

### Upgrade apply

The cluster components can be upgraded with the command:

```bash
kubeadm upgrade apply v1.24.0
```

/!\ The *kubelets* are not managed by kubeadm and must be upgraded manually.

### *kubelet* upgrade

On each master node, upgrade kubelet

```bash
apt-get upgrade -y kubelet=1.24.0-00
systemctl restart kubelet
```

## Worker Nodes

### Drain worker node

```bash
# Evict running pods and cordon the node
kubectl drain node-1
```

### Upgrade *kubeadm* and *kubelet*

```bash
apt-get upgrade -y kubeadm=1.24.0-00
apt-get upgrade -y kubelet=1.24.0-00
kubeadm upgrade node phase kubelet-config
systemctl restart kubelet
```

### Uncordon node

```bash
# uncordon the node (re-enable scheduling)
kubectl uncordon node-1
```
