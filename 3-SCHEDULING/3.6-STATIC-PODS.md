# Static Pods

Static Pods are a way for the kubelet **to create directly pods from .yaml** files instead of receiving a HTTP request from the apiServer.

This only apply to pods, not other resources.

This is how the Control Plane creates its system pods when provisionned with kubeadm.

The kubelet scrapes periodically a folder (default */etc/kubernetes/manifests*) and manages creation (yaml added), update (yaml updated) and deletion (yaml removed) of the static pods.

## Configuration

When the kubelet is started as a Linux service,

```
#kubelet.service
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/kubelet \\
...
--pod-manifest-path=etc/kubernetes/manifests
...
```

OR

```
#kubelet.service
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/kubelet \\
...
--config=conf.yaml
...
```
```
#conf.yaml
...
staticPodPath=/etc/kubernetes/manifests
...
```


## Static Pods Mirroring

If the Node is part of a cluster, it also creates a mirror in the apiServer so the pod is visible like any other pod.
```bash
> kubectl get pods
# static pods are named <POD_NAME>-<NODE_NAME>
NAME                          READY ....
static-pod-node01             1/1
```

The static pod's details are available from the kube apiServer.

However unlike a regular pod, you can't edit or delete it through apiServer. You will need to modify the yaml file from the manifest folder.
