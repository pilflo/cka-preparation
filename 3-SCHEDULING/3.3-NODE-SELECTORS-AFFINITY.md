# Node Selectors and Node Affinity

## Node Selectors

A *nodeSelector* is a Pod's property for scheduling the Pod in a given Node according to Node's labels.

```bash
kubectl label nodes node01 size=Large
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
  labels:
    env: test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  nodeSelector:
    size:Large
```

A nodeSelector is enough for simple scheduling, however for more logic/options, there is *node affinity*.

## Node Affinity

```yaml
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
            operator: In
            values:
            - antarctica-east1
            - antarctica-west1
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: another-node-label-key
            operator: In
            values:
            - another-node-label-value
```

There are 3 types of affinity:

- **requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution** : applies strictly the affinity during scheduling but does not evict already scheduled pods that would not match the *matchExpressions*.
- **preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution** : applies the affinity if possible during scheduling but does not evict already scheduled pods that would not match the *matchExpressions*.
- **requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution** : applies strictly the affinity during scheduling AND evicts pods that do not match the matchExpressions.

## Taints and Tolerations vs Node Affinity

Taints/Tolerations and Node Affinity are two complementary notions.

- Taints **PREVENT** pods without associated tolerations to be scheduled on a given node/set of nodes.
- Affinities **ENFORCE** the scheduling of a set of pods (with the correct label) to a node/set of nodes.
